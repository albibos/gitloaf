# Gitloaf
Gitloaf an open sourced cdn that displays files from github with their correct content type headers. See a list of supported files here: https://gitloaf.com/filetypes.html Similar to raw.githack.com, except using nodejs and express instead of nginx configs.

Gitloaf caches file data for short periods of time in order to provide a quicker experience.
You can use the jsdelivr cdn instead of the github cdn by switching /cdn/ with /cfcdn/ in the url.

### OUTDATED README
Now serviced under Carbon Systems!

# Warning
A few 3kh0-Assets games will likely not work due to current issues. Please bear with me while I implement fixes to these issues! DM or Ping me on discord (Albinus#4220) and tell me the non-working games and share to me a screenshot of the console so I can see the errors! Most should work though :)
